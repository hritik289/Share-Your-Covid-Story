# Share-Your-Covid-Story

#Overview
The core aim of the project is to provide a safe and collaborative platform, where COVID survivors share
the pain and struggles they had to go through during the ordeal. To provide people with such a platform
which is safe for people to share their stories we have incorporated ML Technologies on our blogging
sites. Which detects toxicity from the blog posts and deletes those posts, providing a safer platform for
the community. Any posts having toxicity levels beyond a certain threshold will be removed.
